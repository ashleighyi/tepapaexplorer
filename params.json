So, pretty much what you were expecting\r\n-- except, of course, for how it's put together, specifically:\r\n\r\n- It's built on Skel 3*, a leaner, more modular rewrite of my responsive framework.\r\n\r\n  (* = still in development as of this writing)\r\n\r\n- It uses flexbox*, which eliminates all kinds of terrible hacks and clunky layout\r\n  stopgaps (like CSS grid systems).\r\n\r\n  (* = not supported on IE8/9, but non-flexbox fallbacks are included)\r\n\r\n- It uses Sass* a lot more intelligently, thanks in part to several new mixins\r\n  and functions I've been working on (as well as a few by @HugoGiraudel).\r\n\r\n  (* = still entirely optional if you prefer vanilla CSS :)\r\n\r\n- A ton of other stuff.\r\n\r\nIn short, Spectral's the culmination of several new things I'm working on/trying out,\r\nso please, let me know what you think :)\r\n\r\nDemo images* courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images\r\nyou can use for pretty much whatever.\r\n\r\n(* = not included)\r\n\r\nAJ\r\nn33.co @n33co dribbble.com/n33\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\n\tDemo Images:\r\n\t\tUnsplash (unsplash.com)\r\n\r\n\tIcons:\r\n\t\tFont Awesome (fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome)\r\n\r\n\tOther:\r\n\t\tjQuery (jquery.com)\r\n\t\thtml5shiv.js (@afarkas @jdalton @jon_neal @rem)\r\n\t\tbackground-size polyfill (github.com/louisremi)\r\n\t\tMisc.
